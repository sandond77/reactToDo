# React To Do List
This application was built with Vite React with MaterialUI components. It is currently deployed at https://reacttodo-q1hg.onrender.com/. 

## Purpose
This application serves as a basic todo list. The user is able to add their own tasks and mark them as completed as needed. Completed tasks will be designated with a line-through. If there are too many tasks, the user is also able to delete tasks individually. The saved tasks are stored on LocalSession, so individual users will not see other users' tasks.
